Decision trees are fundamental tools in machine learning projects, used for both classification and regression tasks. They visually represent decision-making processes, breaking down complex problems into simpler, sequential questions. In classification, they predict categorical outcomes (e.g., spam/not spam), while in regression, they predict continuous values (e.g., house prices). They're widely applied in areas like medical diagnosis, fraud detection, and customer segmentation due to their interpretability. Common tools and libraries used to implement decision trees include scikit-learn in Python, which provides efficient implementations for building and evaluating these models.
